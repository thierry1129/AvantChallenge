#  A guide to use the app
## app is best runned under iPhone 8 Plus simulator
### steps


1. start the app in simulator

2. enter information for new card
    ..* card name cannot be the same as old cards, APR and credit limit cannot be lower than 0.
    .. * Even though highly unlikely, I will for now allow higher than 100% APR

3. click on submit button, it should take you to card list view, with a list of cards.

4. to inquire card balance, enter date ( 0 ~ positive N)  on the card list view
    ..* Please click enter on your keyboard after you are finished with an input, i found the function to track whether user has finished editing to be quite laggy on my end.

5. to keep track of card transaction histories. click on a card on the card list view, you should see a list of transaction for a specific card.
    ..* positive amount indicates that you are spending moeny, negative means you are repaying credit card.

6. if you want to make a transaction on a specific card, click on the new transaction button

7. for simplicity purposes, if you are spending money, please enter positive amount, if you are repaying the credit card, please enter negative amount

8. for simplicity purposes, card data is not saved, so you need to create new card between app launches.

9. for simplicity purposes, date ranges from 0 to n, 0 as the oepening card date, N is a positive integer indicating the future. 

10. Assume every month has 30 days.

11.  Input boxes are prefilled for your easiest testing experience.
